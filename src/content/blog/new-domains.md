description: how to get free domains, and my two newly brought domains
---
Hey guys, it has been a while since I had last posted and I wanted to update that I've gotten some new domains and i'll explain how i got them, and how you can get some for yourself! 
> you have to be 13 or older to do this

The main reason I have got them is that last year (specifically my 7-8th grade year) I had to use owned the domain **sillyangel.me** but then that had expired so, I had to go back to using **sillyangel.github.io**.

## Hackclub Highseas

I have gotten the domains by using [Hack Club's YSWS "High Seas."](https://ahoy.hack.club/12461) You basically add a programming time tracker that tracks you, then you go into the High Seas website and draft a ship (ships are projects). Then, it goes to the Wonderdome, where others vote on which of the two is better. After a little bit, you earn doubloons, which you can spend in the shop.

For me, on the other hand, I created my project, which was an off-brand Spotify redesign. The base took me 12 hours and rewarded me with 160 doubloons. I spent 40 doubloons for a domain under $10 at [porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com/) and bought two: [sillyangel.xyz](https://sillyangel.xyz) and [sillyangel.fyi](https://sillyangel.fyi). I don't have a nice use for the **.fyi** domain, but they expire next year.
## Hackclub Nest

Hackclub Nest is a free program that provides students a Linux server to host anything they want. However, there are some [limits](https://guides.hackclub.app/index.php/Limitations) and a [Policy](https://guides.hackclub.app/index.php/Acceptable_Use_Policy) will have to followed in order to keep your server. You can follow a [quickstart guide](https://guides.hackclub.app/index.php/Quickstart) on their website. Additionally, they also provide  emails under **hackclub.app** eg., **sillyangel@hackclub.app**.
## Github Student Education Pack 

Github's Student Pack is the best one out of the two, I had used this to obtain my **sillyangel.me** domain and, this also gives students many more benefits. ( you can view all of the benefits [here](https://education.github.com/pack) )

Steps to apply:
1. Create a GitHub account
2. Open the [Education Application](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application) 
3. Apply for it, and wait until they accept you
4. Get the [Namecheap Offer](https://nc.me/github/auth)

after that you can follow my other blog post setting up the domain on cloudflare.
